->POJO - plain old java object
->in Autowired - Field injection is not recommended
-> How Spring Resolve Dependencies?
  1. By Type -> EmailService
  2. If multiple beans -> use name or @Qualifier
  3. If still ambiguous -> use @Primary

  Task
-> Create a class called CakeBaker, that is dependent on two other classes called Frosting and Syrup. This class has a function called bakeCake().
-> Create two interfaces of type Frosting and Syrup with a function called getFrostingType and getSyrupType respectively.
-> Create two implementations of these two interfaces (so total 4 classes) for Chocolate and Strawberry flavors.
-> Use Dependency injection to inject the Frosting and Syrup dependencies into CakeBaker and also to call the bakeCake function of the CakeBaker class.

Solution Steps:
  1-Create interfaces Frosting and Syrup.
  2-Create implementations: ChocolateFrosting, StrawberryFrosting, ChocolateSyrup, StrawberrySyrup. Mark components with explicit bean names.
  3-Create CakeBaker that uses constructor injection with @Qualifier to pick implementations.
  4-Update Module1introductionApplication to call cakeBaker.bakeCake() on startup.
